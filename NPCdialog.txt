Hey kid.Here's your Sage, keep in mind that time waits for no one, even with potions.
I heard that Mandrakes like to run around. Is that true?
Delivery? Great! Have a good day, remember to prioritize your routes.
Busy day ahead? Keep it up. Be careful and keep track of the time.
Mandrakes run a lot, but catching and collecting its leaves can double potion yields!
Thank you. Keep track of what your making, it's important to earn some profit.
Serve what you can to get the best outcome and finish up for the day.
Oh morning! As a business owner you need to track and manage your time, like me! I water my plants exactly at 7AM sharp. Here is your Basil.
Chase, chase and catch that mandrake.
I hate waking up early.
